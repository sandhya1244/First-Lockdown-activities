		<h2>Code For Change</h2>
	<p>To be honest at this tough times i really did lots of work in code for change.It won’t take you long to get ready like you used to and start working from home, work with positive mindset and remember things gonna be better soon and never stop being thankful for the opportunities you are getting! 
    Be happy and take care of yourself because that’s all we can do right now!
    It helps me to groom myself with my colleague.Since i am computer science student, i really don;t know more knowledge in IT field . I am in learning phase .I did various works in code for change during lockdown.If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.my future goal is to be an entrepreneur."Entrepreneurs Are Simply Those Who Understand That There Is Little Difference Between Obstacle And
    Opportunity And Are Able To Turn Both To Their Advantage." – Victor Kiam <br>Some of my work during lockdown of this pandemic covid-19.
